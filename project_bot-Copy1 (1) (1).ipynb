       "'6B Pencils: This pencil is best for those who like to \\ndraw, and it is particularly meant for adding dark values \\nto your drawing pieces. This is also a great option for creating portraits where you would want to achieve realistic textures like skin, fur or fabric. (Fig 5)\\n5B Pencils: This pencil produces a darker mark than \\nthe ones after it and is quite softer than a 2B pencil for \\nexample. This is because the higher number of B that a pencil is, the softer the pencil will be. (Fig 6)\\nFig 1\\nPGN121221\\n19 Paint\\t&\\tCoating:\\tPainter\\t(General)\\t-\\t(NSQF\\t-\\tLevel\\t5)\\tRelated\\tTheory\\tfor\\tExercise\\t1.2.12\\t-\\t1.2.17204B\\tPencils:\\t The 4B pencil is slightly lighter than the ones \\nbefore it and is also an excellent choice for sketching \\nand drawing purposes. Anyone with an aptitude for art and drawing will definitely enjoy using this pencil.  \\n(Fig 7)\\n3B\\tPencils:\\t This pencil is more like a mix of dark and \\nlight but is more towards a lighter gray. It is an ideal \\noption for those who like their drawings to contain light values with with slight shades of dark gray. (Fig 8)\\n2B Pencils: This 2B pencil is best for medium to dark \\nshading and provides a good range of tone or value \\nfrom light to a dark shade. It is commonly used shading and sketching. (Fig 9)\\nH Pencils: In this case, ‘H’ refers to the hardness of \\nthe pencil. This is to say that the higher the value of H \\na pencil has, the harder its lead will be. And the harder the lead is, the lightest the pencil will be.\\nThe ‘H’ pencils are generally very hard, and they are \\nable to hold a tip in place, ensuring extreme precision. They also make light lines that can be erased with great \\nPaint\\t&\\tCoating:\\tPainter\\t(General)\\t-\\t(NSQF\\t-\\tLevel\\t5)\\tRelated\\tTheory\\tfor\\tExercise\\t1.2.12\\t-\\t1.2.17This pencil falls in the exact middle of the pencil lead \\nscale. HB is a significantly hard pencil, making it a reasonably hard pencil even for drawing purposes.  \\n(Fig 10)\\nThe ‘H’ refers to the hardness of the pencil, and the \\nletter ‘B’ is used to denote the blackness of the particular pencil’s mark.\\nF: ‘F’ stands for fine point. This pencil, compared to the \\nothers is slightly harder. While it is certainly easier than \\na few to keep sharp, it is way too dark for general and everyday drawing. (Fig 11)ease and convenience so one can easily use these pencils to design products or write things on paper.\\nThis pencil type is great for any technical work that \\ninvolves making lines that are easily erasable. This is particularly because 2H contains a very light amount of lead. It is also a great option for those who just begun to draw and wish to add very light shades to their drawing. (Fig 12)\\n3H\\tPencil: 3H is an extremely light shade of gray that \\nleaves a very light imprint on paper. It can be a great \\nchoice for sketches where you need to add light shades or slightly fill in the empty spaces with a pencil. (Fig 13)\\n4H\\tPencil:\\t This is an excellent choice of pencil for light, \\nfine and even shading. It is more towards the gray side \\nand less shiny because of the amount of clay it contains. It is also easier to keep sharp so can be easily used for shading and sketching. (Fig 14)\\n5H Pencil: This type of pencil helps create the darkest \\nand the thinnest of lines, given its hardness levels. This \\nhappens because it falls towards the end of the ‘H’ or hardness scale, hence, giving a hard touch. It is a great option particularly for those who are into drawing and sketching and wish to draw dark and thinnest lines.  \\n(Fig 15)\\n6H Pencil: This is a top-quality graphite pencil that is \\nprimarily designed for the purpose of sketching, writing, \\nand drawing. It is an ideal pencil for artistic and technical applications. (Fig 16)21Keeping in mind the hardness rule, it gives maximum \\nhardness with the darkest and thinnest look on paper.\\nBy pencil shading on the paper surface triangular effect'"
